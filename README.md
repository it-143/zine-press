# DEEMS — Digital Zine Archive

A web-based zine gallery featuring a pulsating pastel gradient landing page, macOS-style dropdown navigation, 3D spinning zine objects, and a full-page reader with magazine-style spread view.

## Overview

DEEMS is an independent digital zine archive built as a static site hosted on GitHub Pages. The project combines several visual and interactive elements:

- **Pastel Gradient Landing Page** — A slowly shifting pastel gradient background with pulsating concentric rings and the DEEMS glow logo centered on screen. Navigation is handled by a macOS-style frosted glass dropdown menu in the top left corner.

- **3D Zine Gallery** — Nine volumes of DEEMS displayed as spinning 3D objects built with Three.js. Each zine has its actual front and back cover art mapped as textures. The renderer uses a low pixel ratio for a pixelated aesthetic with CRT-style scanlines, set against the same pulsating pastel gradient background for visual consistency across pages.

- **Magazine Reader** — Click any zine to open a full-screen reader. On desktop, interior pages display as two-page spreads like an open magazine. On mobile, pages show one at a time with swipe-to-flip support. All pages render crisp and clear, contrasting the pixelated gallery behind.

- **Dropdown Navigation** — A frosted glass "DEEMS ▾" dropdown in the top left of every page, styled after macOS menus with grouped sections for Archive, Explore, and Connect links.

## Tech Stack

- **Three.js (r128)** — 3D zine rendering via CDN
- **CSS Animations** — Pulsating pastel gradient background, pulse rings
- **Canvas API** — Procedural zine spine and edge textures
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — No frameworks, no build step
- **GitHub Pages** — Static hosting

## Adding Pages to a Volume

1. Export your zine pages as JPGs (~800px wide, ~80% JPEG quality, aim for 100-250KB each)
2. Name them: `front.jpg`, `page1.jpg`, `page2.jpg`, ..., `back.jpg`
3. Create a folder `images/volX/` in the repo and upload the JPGs
4. In `app.js`, find the volume in the `ZINES` array and add a `pages` property:

```js
{ id:2, title:"DEEMS Vol.2", ..., frontImg:F2, backImg:B2,
  pages: [
    'images/vol2/front.jpg',
    'images/vol2/page1.jpg',
    'images/vol2/page2.jpg',
    // ...
    'images/vol2/back.jpg'
  ] },
```

5. Push to GitHub — the reader will automatically show all pages with spread view on desktop and single-page view on mobile.

Volumes without a `pages` array will still display their front and back covers in the reader.

## Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop (600px+):** 3×3 grid of spinning zines, two-page spread reader
- **Mobile (<600px):** 2-column grid with larger zines, single-page reader with swipe navigation, touch-to-tap support

## Key Design Decisions

- **Shared background language:** Both `index.html` and `zines.html` use the same pulsating pastel CSS gradient so the site feels like one continuous world as you navigate between pages.
- **CSS background, not canvas:** The gradient background is pure CSS `linear-gradient` animation rather than a canvas paint loop, keeping it lightweight and GPU-accelerated.
- **z-index stack on zines.html:** gradient (0) → pulse rings (1) → Three.js canvas (2) → header/UI (higher). Three.js uses `alpha: true` so the pastel background shows through.
- **Pixelated 3D, crisp reader:** The gallery deliberately renders at a low pixel ratio (0.4) with `image-rendering: pixelated` for a lo-fi aesthetic. The reader switches to `image-rendering: auto` so pages are sharp and readable.
- **Projection-based click detection:** Three.js raycasting breaks with low pixel ratios, so click detection projects 3D positions to screen coordinates and checks proximity instead.
- **Self-contained:** Cover textures are base64-encoded in `images.js` so the 3D gallery works without any image loading. Interior pages load from the `images/` folder on demand.
